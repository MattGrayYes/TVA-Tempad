# TVA Tempad
Code for my TVA Tempad prop replica


## Hardware
*  [Pimoroni Pico Lipo 16Mb](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-lipo?variant=39335427080275), running [CircuitPython 9.1.1](https://circuitpython.org/board/pimoroni_picolipo_16mb/)
*  [Adafruit #5846 3.5" TFT 320x480 with Capacitive Touch Breakout Board - EYESPI](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5846)
*  [Adafruit #5613 EYESPI Breakout Board - 18 Pin FPC Connector](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5613)

With SPI pin number changes, it should work on most CircuitPython boards.

## 3D Printing
I've printed all the parts successfuly both with the [Bambu Lab A1 Combo](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2485357&u=4351340&m=138211&urllink=&afftrack=) and the [Bambu Lab X1 Carbon](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2353821&u=4351340&m=138211&urllink=&afftrack=).

In my final products, the base, base lid, and buttons are multi-material 3D prints.

I've exported the models as:

* 3MF files for BambuStudio, with multimaterial and support information.
* generic STL files.
